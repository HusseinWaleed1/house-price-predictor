## 🏠 California House Price Prediction App

This application predicts house prices in California using the **California Housing Dataset** from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset).

### 📌 How it Works:
1. **Data Collection:**  
   We used the California Housing dataset which contains median house values for districts in California.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure better model performance.
   
3. **Model Training:**  
   A `RandomForestRegressor` model was trained to predict median house prices.

4. **Deployment:**  
   The trained model and scaler were saved using `joblib` and integrated with **Streamlit** for the web interface.
